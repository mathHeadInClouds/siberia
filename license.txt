Landru license

Please do not use this software - nobody should use it.

Image all this copying of code (of honor, of conduct, of computer) - all this "going with the herd" - would halt.

Imagine people thinking for themselves, being individuals, like actual humans do; not being dull, boring,
average-in-every-aspect, grey, spineless, sexless, rootless, spiritless, obedient "I didn't do it" zombies any more.

It sure is comfortable to be a docile cloned half corpse, but why do _you_ want to go that way? Don't do this to yourself.
You can write this software by yourself. I know you can. Do it! Takes time you say? Then *take* the time.
*Rob* the time, don't say "may I". If you write it yourself, you grow, and if you copy it, you shrink. Much like
growing new skin, versus scraping off some skin to make an ultra-tight hat fit. Have you not shrunken enough? Is
there anything left of _you_? Hello? Anybody in there?

In case you decide to not follow above advice, and you use this software anyway, please include this notice.

And if you decide not to follow the foregoing request, and don't include this notice, that's OK. Maybe it's better that way.
Because, I have a hunch this notice might act like the "smoking kills" labels - the way opposite to what's purported.
("I read that beautiful warning message, and still I'm copying - I really must (be stupid || love being uncreative || ...)")

In that case, please have a beer on me, and have a laugh while choosing any of the available "standard" licences at random,
using the uniform distribution. Or just go with any formally correct version of: "I am allowed to use this code, but you
aren't - na-na-na-na-naaaa-naaa". Actually, yeah, I think that's best. But do what _you_ think is best in that regard, OK?

Implied and express warranties: I gurantee that copying code instead of writing it yourself makes you more stupid.
That's all I guarantee. Except that, on the short run, being more stupid makes you more happy. That's why I recommend
copying so highly.

TLDR: If you're so used to being told what to do that "do what you think is best" is unintelligible gibberish to you,
then just follow the will of Landru**.

**I think they call it "best practices" nowadays.
